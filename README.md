#### Need to knows for the group

##### Designated Communication Channels -
  * teams chat
  * out of class catch up period to be decided/general make sure you are available time
  * if you are stuck don't be afraid to ask for input from the others, not really a rule just a good idea
  * Check the issues tab and the discord at least once daily, no muting the server!
  * When you take a task from the Kanban board make sure you assign yourself to it so it's clear who is doing what!
  
##### Process for resolving merge conflicts
  * post an issue on here(github) for the big ones and just create a thread for the smaller ones in the merge conflicts channel in the discord server linked above.
  * aka use the comms channels that be relevant for the thing

##### Code checking standards -
  * SEMICOLONS AND BRACKETS - Check them
  * Comments
     * your name, quick descriptor of chunk of code, and timestamp of last edit 
     * Specify if bit of code is working, WIP or broken
  * Don't muck with other people's code without asking

###### Watch out for caps when adding files

##### Studio Rules:
1) progress = usable software
2) Only write code that everyone can understand
3) always discuss with your team before you make any change to the code / don't muck with other people's bits without asking
4) iterate
5) one feature finished is better than a bunch not
6) make the simplest possible version then add incremental improvements
7) do individual dev work outside of class / Do your homework
