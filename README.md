#Need to knows for the group

- Designated Communication Channels -
  *teams chat
  *Discord: https://discord.gg/Gq4Arkq6
  *out of class catch up period to be decided / general make sure you are available time
  *if you are stuck dont be afraid to ask for input from the others, not really a rule just a good idea
  *Check the issues tab and the discord at least once daily, no muting the server!!
  *When you take a task from the Kanbahn board make sure you assign yourself to it so it's clear who is doing what!
  *
  


- Process for resolving merge conflicts -
  * post an issue on here(github) for the big ones and just create a thread for the smaller ones in the merge conflicts channel in the discord server linked above.
  *aka use the comms channels that be relevant for the thing

- Code checking standards -
  *SEMICOLONS AND BRACKETS - Check them
  *Comments
     *your name, quick descriptor of chunk of code, and timestamp of last edit 
     *Specify if bit of code is working, WIP or broken
  *Don't muck with other people's code without asking
  *

watch out for caps when adding files


Studio Rules:
1) progress == usable software
2) Only write code that everyone can understand
3) always discuss with your team before you make any change to the code / don't muck with other people's bits without asking
4) iterate
5) one feature finished is better than a bunch not
6) make the simplest possible version then add incremental improvements
7) do individual dev work outside of class / Do your homework

8) 10(ish) commits per week per person - not just in class
